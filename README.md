# candy-land
This is a simple card 'draw-er' for Candy Land by Hasbro.

I only gave myself 30 minutes to complete this so there are
many improvements that could be made.

I would like to create a graphic user interface and add a usb button
that would draw the card. Ideally, this would help young children
draw cards that may have a hard time holding cards and/or drawing cards.
